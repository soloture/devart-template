## Prototypes
Since Twitter Noise Machine is aiming to reconstruct the concept of data space from the user side, I wanted the experience to be extremely individual. What would ambient sound of an alternative digital space sound like? It was important to recreate a similar acoustic experience that sounds informative, but actually is sensible and incomprehensible. This is the first prototype, 'sounds like language but not really a language'.

The prototype #1 was field recordings of Twitter Noise at certain locations near Los Angeles. At this stage, the machine had not have any physical form yet.

The second prototype was designed to focus on an individual experience.A directional speaker mounted on a base turns toward the closest audience, plays Twitter Noise of the specific direction. As a result, the audience becomes to hear Twitter activity of the position where he or she is standing. Unlike the prototype #1, #2 was created to allow audience to actively move and explore Twitter Noise. 


## The final installation plan

Audience will walk into a hexagonal room with 6 speakers installed at each point. The speakers play Twitter Noise of each directions, allow the audience to experience the sonic landscape recreated by Twitter Noise Machine.
