## The final installation plan

![Installation plan](project_images/installationplan.jpg?raw=true "Installation plan")

Audience will walk into a hexagonal room with 6 speakers installed at each point. The speakers play Twitter Noise of each directions, allow the audience to experience the sonic landscape recreated by Twitter Noise Machine. Twitter Noise Machine provides a contact point between the real landscape and data landscape, and exposes the complex ecosystem behind screens in a corporeal form. By doing that, the machine creates an idiosyncratic space where invisible data becomes sentient, and it blurs the line between the real world, which is material, and the data space, which is conceptual. That transforms reality into something composite, complex, and new.
