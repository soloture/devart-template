The second prototype was designed to focus on an individual experience.A directional speaker mounted on a base turns toward the closest audience, plays Twitter Noise of the specific direction. As a result, the audience becomes to hear Twitter activity of the position where he or she is standing. Unlike the prototype #1, #2 was created to allow audience to actively move and explore Twitter Noise. 
Soundlazer was used to play directional sounds, and Arduino was used to make the speaker facing the audience. The sonification process was done in the same way as the prototype #1.
