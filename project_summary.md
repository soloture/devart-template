## Description
Twitter Noise Machine is an attempt to shape data space entirely distinct from machine side structure, focusing instead on observations of user side phenomena, starting with the question of where digital data exists. An answer to the question can be various, but generally, digital data is considered to be bound to physical devices, and our relationship with data has been established by design and technology largely based on this common idea. However, in a specific dataset such as geographic coordinate system, the existence of data can be defined differently. Any dataset associated with geographical coordinate system can have geographical presence in the same way buildings, trees, or mountains with high degree of internal dynamics, and becomes to form an alternative environment. Thus, we sense the presence of data as environmental elements. Twitter Noise Machine explore the meaning of ‘feeling’ the presence of data instead of ‘reading’ it, and the impacts of it, by creating a specific acoustic environment consists of sonified data. Twitter Noise Machine turn Twitter entries that have certain GPS values close to a certain location into "noise" with automated real time process, so that it creates a space where the wall between the virtual space and the real space collapse.
